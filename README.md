## Info

A simple meditation app including a meditation timer with a singing bowl start & finish, meditation logs and much more to come. This was a group project for Enspiral Dev Academy bootcamp.

As we only had one day to complete this project, there are many stretch goals and functionalities we did not have a chance to build. We intend to continue working on this project in our spare time to develop something really awesome!
